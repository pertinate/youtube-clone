# ts-express-template
> A template for creating your own Typescript project

## Prerequisites
> Cloning the project and running ```npm install``` will cover most of the prerequisites. To update the ```package.json``` with your git repo, remove the objects you want to update i.e: ```repository```, ```bugs```, ```homepage``` and run the ```npm init``` command.

> Visit the [Docker guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker.

## Getting Started
> Run the Following

```npm install```

> This template uses a development container to provide a standardized os. In this case, we are using an Alpine OS container that comes with NodeJS 14.13.1. This is consistent with the Dockerfile as well. To start the container run the following:

```npm run dev:container```

> This will start the container and gives you access to the shell. Afterwards, run ```npm run dev``` to start ```ts-node-dev```
